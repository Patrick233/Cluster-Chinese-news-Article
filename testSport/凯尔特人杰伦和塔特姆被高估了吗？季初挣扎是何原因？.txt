Are we overrating the Celtics young talent?凯尔特人年轻球员的天赋水平被高估了吗？Lakersawntawn 於 1 天前 發表湖人球迷（楼主）：整个夏天，大家都在谈论凯尔特人的年轻核心阵容有多么多么出色。（按照他们的说法）杰伦-布朗明显有全明星潜力，但塔特姆就厉害了。我滴乖乖， 你们听说过塔特姆吧没有呀？他已经是全明星级别球员了呢，板上钉钉毫无悬念入选名人堂。He might already the best player on the Celtics, hell the Celtics should probably run their offense through him this year. Kyrie might even consider leaving since he wants to be the man on his team. He's not going to be the man anymore, because Jayson Tatum isn't coming... he's already here.10 games in... where the fuck is everyone, huh?然后呢，大家又说塔特姆或许已经是绿军最好的球员了。凯尔特人今年或许还应该树立他为进攻核心呢。那这样欧文或许甚至会考虑离开呢，毕竟他想当球队老大。欧文不再是球队门面了，因为跟塔特姆的权杖交接可不是遥遥无期，特特姆已经接过火炬了。好了，现在十场打完了，那些吹他的人呢？Despite having solid but unremarkable regular seasons, everyone points to the fact that they showed up big time in the playoffs when it counted. But can we stop and think about what it really means to be big time in the playoffs in the Eastern Conference?凯尔特人这两位年轻球员的常规赛表现都挺不错的，但也说不上非常精彩绝伦，但每个人却又指出他们到了关键的季后赛就能英勇地站出来了。但我们能不能消停下来想一想，什么叫在东部季后赛中英勇地站出来贡献精彩发挥？An Eastern Conference that Lebron James carried these frickin' Cavaliers through by himself? That same Lebron James who might not even make the playoffs now that he's in the West?你们说的是詹姆斯一个人就能带领骑士过五关斩六将的东部？别忘了同样的詹姆斯到了西部可能连季后赛都进不去。The Celtics played a Milwaukee Bucks squad being bogged down by an absolutely horrible coach in Jason Kidd, a young and inexperienced group in the 76ers, and a Cleveland Cavaliers squad that, without Lebron James, is far and away the worst team in basketball.凯尔特人上赛季季后赛面对的是被糟糕透顶的杰森-基德教练拖累的雄鹿、年轻但缺乏经验的76人以及如果没了詹姆斯就妥妥变成篮球界最烂球队的骑士。Maybe, just maybe, they got to feast on three teams that they matched up well against, and that made them look better than they really are? And maybe, just maybe, now that they're up against regular competition again, they're regressing back to what they actually are, which is good young players with amazing potential but are still inconsistent because they're young and inexperienced?也许，只是也许，季后赛的獭兔和杰伦面对这三支球队时在对位上很有优势，所以他们得以大放异彩，让他们的真实水平看起来比实际上更为出色？也许，也只是也许，现在既然他们面对的竞争对手趋于正常水平了，他们也就倒退回了自己的真实水平——年轻又极具潜力，但依旧因为太年轻和没经验而表现不稳定。TL;DR: yes, this is a salty shitpost in response to that other shitpost that got circlejerk upvoted to hell.给嫌太长没读的人总结一下：没错，我发这贴就是回应某个被赞到飞起的帖子（即“湖人球员被高估了”那个帖子）。[–][LAL] Brandon Ingrammeengine 1019指標21小時前Young talent in general is really overrated in the NBA. NBA fans rate young players more about what they ideally can be than what they actually are right now. They are always assuming the young talent will improve consistently year by year under ideal circumstances.湖人球迷：在NBA，年轻球员的天赋大体上都被过分高估了。球迷们评价年轻球员更多地是基于他们在理想状况下可以达到的水平，而不是他们目前的真实水平。很多人总是认为，理想状况下的年轻球员可以一年又一年不断地取得进步。[–]SunsBows_N_Hoes 573指標21小時前I blame 2k where players do naturally progress to an assumed peak.Real world doesn’t work that way.都赖2K啊，游戏里面的球员确实是自然而然地不断进步，直到达到巅峰。现实世界并不是这样的。[–][LAL] Kareem Abdul-JabbarADONBILIVID 104指標17小時前I remember back in the days in NBA2K1 when Kwame Brown, Tyson Chandler, Eddy Curry were rookies (yes I’m going waaaay back) the three of them would eventually go on to be the next Duncan, Shaq & Hakeem.湖人球迷：我记得以前玩的《NBA 2K1》的时候，夸梅-布朗、泰森-钱德勒、埃迪-库里还都是新秀（没错，这是很久很久以前了），然后玩到最后这三位会成长为下一个邓肯、奥尼尔和奥拉朱旺。[–]Partaking 714指標21小時前I am tripping so hard right now.

The 'young' talent are still young afterall, and one thing that young players have always lacked in consistency, so guys like Taytum and Brown have to find it first. Sure it did not help that the playoff run they had last season + the media increased the pressure on expectations, especially with LeBron heading West, but its still early days.热火球迷：我之前选了凯尔特人能冲出东部。虽然目前为止凯尔特人的表现是令人失望的，但我通常在常规赛进行到20-30场的时候才开始作出评价，所以现在来说还为时过早。“年轻”的天赋毕竟是年轻，而年轻球员都存在的问题就是缺乏稳定性，所以像塔特姆和布朗这样的球员必须先做到稳定输出。确实，凯尔特人上赛季打出了精彩的季后赛之旅，而且媒体也给他们的期望值施加了很大压力，特别是现在勒布朗又去了西部，这些种种对他们的心态来说起不到什么正面作用。但现在不管怎么样还是为时尚早啊。[–][BOS] Jaylen Browngbeckwith 136指標14小時前As of now the Raptors are the best team in the East. However, they needed to replace one star with another. We need to work Hayward in and Kyrie was out for months. If this continues, we're clear cut not the best team, but if we gel we have one hell of a ceiling.凯尔特人球迷：就目前来说，猛龙是东部最好的球队。但是，猛龙之前是需要用自己的一位球星换来另一位球星才能达到今天的水平。而我们需要让海沃德尽快找到状态，而且欧文之前还伤了几个月没有打球。如果这种局面继续下去，我们显然不是东部最好的球队，但如果我们能磨合成功，我们的上限会非常可怕的。[–]Celticsfdahood 96指標13小時前I'm not worried yet. We are still picking up steam, despite last nights loss.Edit: Tatum needs to chill with that stupid contested mid-ranger though.凯尔特人球迷：我目前还不担心。我们还在找状态，尽管昨晚的比赛输了。补充：塔特姆别再痴迷于愚蠢的中距离强投了。[–]ArenSteele 59指標12小時前But Kobe said to take that shot!但是科比说能投就别传球！[–]poopfeast180 245指標21小時前nah i think their offense needs to be tweaked and some role players reduced to actual role player specialist duties rather than playing the same way their stars play.不，我认为他们的进攻还需要调整，一些角色球员需要放下身段踏踏实实履行好该做的事，而不是像自家球星那样打球。[–]Heatwalldotfm 148指標21小時前i agree with this. Stevens is a great coach but the minutes distribution is a little odd..我同意这个观点。少帅是一名优秀的教练，但他对球员上场时间的分配有点迷。[–]poopfeast180 74指標21小時前the belief is that by giving everyone equal opportunity and sharing the ball every time they can also motivate people to be engaged on the other end of the floor and not just get bored. this is true but you gotta not go overboard with it especially since in the playoffs against the best teams you can't rely on the bums to carry. give the ball to the superstar so they make shots.这背后的说法是，通过给予每个球员平等的机会，以及一有机会就分享球，那球员们能够受到鼓舞，在防守端也能非常投入，而不感到无聊。这个方向是正确的，但也不能矫枉过正，特别是在季后赛对阵最好的球队们时，你可不能指望那些平庸的家伙带领你走出泥潭。就该把球交给超巨让他们得分。[–]Heatwalldotfm 46指標21小時前yea. its common practice for rotations to be shortened to 8-9 men when the playoffs start, and basically for a team that is sure-fire top 4 seed like Boston is, the regular season is basically for the coach to find out who his bench will be for the playoffs.It will be interesting to see once Hayward is off his minutes restriction.是的。通常来说，到了季后赛，球队的轮换就会减少到8-9人，而对于凯尔特人这种稳获东部前四的球队来说，基本上，常规赛就是为了让教练摸索出季后赛能仰仗的替补阵容。等到海沃德没了上场时间的限制，事情大概就会变得很有趣了。[–][BKN] Rondae Hollis-Jeffersonthehardcoreotter 56指標13小時前Hayward is gonna be on a "he's playing like crap" restriction once that minutes restriction is off篮网球迷：就算等到海沃德的上场时间限制没了，可（按他最近的状态来看）他打得烂的话不一样得被摁到替补席上嘛。[–][MIL] Giannis AntetokounmpoCaptainBananaEu 105指標17小時前*To be fair about LeBron carrying the Cavs to the finals, and now might not come out of the west, LeBron in the regular season and LeBron in the playoffs are 2 different beasts despite being the same animal雄鹿球迷：楼主提到勒布朗带骑士进了总决而现在也许不能杀出西部，我对此要公道地讲一句，常规赛的勒布朗和季后赛的勒布朗是两个不同的野兽，尽管他们是同一种动物（科比的名言）。[–]BullsLoveMeSexyJesus 239指標21小時前Kidd was fired midseason.

Tatum and Brown are pretty damn good, but I swear sometimes people act like they’re the second coming of Jordan and Pippen. They’re good players with bright futures, but for fucks sakeAlso, obligatory hE’s oNlY 20热火球迷：没错，塔特姆和布朗确实很厉害。但我发誓，有时候大家就搞得好像他俩是下一个乔丹和皮蓬一样。他们的确是前途光明的好球员，但是吹得太厉害就太过分了。哦对了，谈到塔特姆是不是还得自动地提到他才二十岁呀。[–][WAS] Brendan HaywoodPerfection_Merchant 77指標15小時前Young talent in the NBA is generally very god damn overrated, after Tyreke Evans put up 20/5/5 you had people already declare him a future superstar. Players don’t progress like that.总的来说，NBA的年轻球员的天赋都被大大高估了，泰瑞克-埃文斯新秀赛季打出20+5+5的表现后就有人说他是未来超巨。然而球员们并不是那么一步一个脚印完成进步的。Also, in legitimately hate how some fans here don’t want to trade young talent for proven superstars. If the Pelicans call Danny Ainge “Give us Tatum, Jaylen Brown and a pick and we give you Anthony Davis” I have no doubt in my mind that Danny Ainge is saying yes before Demps can finish his sentence. You can only hope young guys can become superstars, you trade them for proven superstars every single damn time.而且啊，有些球迷不想用有天赋的年轻球员去换已经证明过自己的超巨，我是真的讨厌这种想法。如果鹈鹕给安吉打电话说：“你们出塔特姆、布朗和一个选秀权，我们出浓眉”，我敢保证安吉没等他说完整句话就得赶紧点头答应了。你只能祈祷自家的年轻人可以成长为超巨，如果有机会的话，你十次有十一次都得决绝地用他们交易得到那些已经证明过自己的超巨呀！[–][SAS] Manu GinobiliPoIIux 117指標14小時前Nah you're wrong.
