原标题：《BBC今日短语：怎样用英语表达“争吵不休”？》　今日短语很多人认为 “猫和狗” 是天敌。如果这两种动物打起架来，那会是怎样的一番情景呢？表达 “fight like cat and dog 像猫和狗一样打架” 形容 “人与人之间的争吵非常激烈、吵得不可开交”。例句My older brother and I used to fight like cat and dog when we were younger. We argued all the time.我和我哥哥小的时候吵得很厉害，一天到晚吵个不停。We can't let them work together; they just fight like cat and dog. They never agree on anything.我们不能让他俩一起工作，不然他们会一直吵个不停的。这两个人从来没有在任何事上达成一致。The two students didn’t like each other– they were always fighting like cat and dog. Their arguments disturbed the other students, so they were often asked to leave their class by the teacher.那两个学生彼此看不上眼，总吵个不停。他们的争吵影响到了其他学生，所以老师经常把他俩请出教室。文章来源：BBC英语教学实习编辑：涂鸿娟  责任编辑：润琰
