Mother Teresa of Calcutta was often quoted as saying： “I know God will not give me anything I can‘t handle。 I just wish He didn’t trust me so much。” Over the years I have found myself often feeling the same way。 I have had a blessed life， but it has never been an easy one。加尔各答的特蕾莎修女有句经常被引用的话：“我知道上帝不会给我无法完成的事情，我只希望他不要那么信任我。”在过去的几十年中我也有同样的感受，生活虽然蒙福，但却不易。In my 45 years I have had to deal with sickness， injuries， accidents， and pain。 I have had to deal with years of poverty and financial struggles。 I have had to deal with my sons‘ mental handicaps， the death of loved ones， and being separated from those I love。 I have had to deal with anger， betrayal， confusion， depression and at times even despair。在45年的岁月中我经历了疾病、伤害、事故、痛苦。除了连年的贫困和经济上的窘迫，我还要只顾上智力有障碍的儿子，与所爱之人天人永隔、被迫分离。还要面对悲愤、背叛、困惑、压抑甚至还有时不时的绝望。Like so many before me I have asked the question： Why do bad things happen to good people？ It is a question that has been asked throughout the ages。 Books have even been written about it。像许多前人一样，我也不禁要问：“为什么好人要遭受这么多的劫难？”这个问题被追问已久，书上也没有答案。When I remember all that I have faced and gone through in this life， I realize that God has used all of it to eventually make me better。 With pain came empathy。 With grief came healing。 With frustration came patience。当我回忆起此生所经历的那些事情，我顿悟到原来上帝这么做是为了最终让我们成为更好的人。痛苦带来同理之心，悲哀带来救助之心，挫折带来静候之心。With struggles came strength。 With sorrow came joy。 With anger came love。 And with despair came trust in God。 Every test， challenge， and tragedy eventually led me to greater goodness， greater love， and greater Oneness with our Heavenly Father。化悲愤为力量，苦尽甘来，因恨生爱。绝望中相信上帝的救赎。每一关、每一个挑战，每一个悲剧在上帝的指引下让我更仁慈、博爱，成为更好的人。None of us likes the negative experiences in life。 None of us enjoys pain。 None of us wants to go through sorrow。 May each day here then help you to grow better and more loving。没有人喜欢负面经历，也没有人喜欢痛苦，跟没有人喜欢历经悲伤。愿每天你都能成为更好的自己，更懂得爱。来源：沪江英语
