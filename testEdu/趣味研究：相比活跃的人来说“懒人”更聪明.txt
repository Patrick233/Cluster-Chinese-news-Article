New research seems to prove the theory that brainy people spend more time lazing around than their active counterparts。 新的研究似乎证明：相比那些活跃的人来讲，聪明的人会更懒散一点。Findings from a US-based study seem to support the idea that people with a high IQ get bored less easily， leading them to spend more time engaged in thought。 美国的一项研究似乎支持这个观点，一个高智商的人不容易感到无聊，他们也会花更多的时间进行思考。The ‘need for cognition’ questionnaire asked participants to rate how strongly they agree with statements such as “I really enjoy a task that involves coming up with new solutions to problems”， and “I only think as hard as I have to”。 关于认知需要的问卷调查——要求调查对象针对如“我真的很喜欢一个需要想出问题新的解决方法任务”，以及“我只是觉得我要努力”等这些语句的认知程度进行打分。The researchers， led by Todd McElroy， then selected 30 ‘thinkers’ and 30 ‘non-thinkers’ from the pool of candidates。由托德·麦克尔罗伊带头的研究小组从调查候选人里选择了30位“思考者”和“非思考者”。Results showed the thinking group were far less active during the week than the non-thinkers。 结果表明在一周内思考者一组远不如非思考者一组活跃。He suggested that the less active people， no matter how clever they are， should aim to raise their overall activity levels to improve their health他建议不太活跃的人，不管他们有多聪明，都应该提高他们的整体活动水平来改善他们的健康状态。本文来源：沪江英语
